Hello there! My name is A'Layis and thank you for visiting my website. 
I am an aspiring front end web developer who is hopefully starting my journey with you.
I have an Associates Degree in Software Development and I personally coded this very website.
I realized at a young age that problem solving is not only something that I am good at but also something that I enjoy to do. 
The immediate satisfaction of solving a problem or helping someone is something that brings me immense joy. 
Software development is a way that I can do both that and build towards something bigger. 
I would love the chance to show my abilities and develop them further while working for your company.
